# AngularJsHeroes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## How to generate feature components

Keeping all features in one component as the application grows will not be maintainable.

You'll want to split up large components into smaller sub-components, each focused on a specific task or workflow.

> ng generate component <componentName>

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## How to generate services

Services focus on presenting data and delegate data access to a service.

From this [tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt4) it will mock data.

> ng generate service <serviceName>

## How to generate AppRoutingModule

> ng generate module app-routing --flat --module=app

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
